## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Modules
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Mobile-first responsive design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/)
- TypeScript

### What I learned

- How to convert static HTML/CSS/JS into reusable components using the Next.js App Router
- Scoped styling using CSS Modules with camelCase naming conventions
- Accessible dropdown menus using `aria-expanded` and keyboard interaction
- Responsive layout structure using CSS Grid with consistent alignment between sections

### Continued development

- Extract dropdown logic into its own component
- Add full keyboard navigation and tab-index support for menus
- Add automated tests for accessibility and interactive behavior
- Experiment with Tailwind CSS or Styled Components for future scalability
