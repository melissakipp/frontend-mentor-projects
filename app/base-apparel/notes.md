## Notes on Base Apparel Project

This document outlines the key aspects of the "Coming Soon" page coding challenge for Base Apparel, completed as part of Frontend Mentor's resources for beginners.

### Coding Challenge Summary

**Overview:**

I recently tackled a coding challenge that involved creating a "Coming Soon" page for Base Apparel. This challenge, designed for newbies, required me to meticulously replicate a provided design document using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was free to utilize any additional tools or libraries I deemed appropriate.

**Process:**

- Followed the design document closely to ensure visual fidelity.
- Utilized HTML for the core structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity (if applicable).
- Leveraged additional tools or libraries as needed.

### CSS Challenges

**Responsive Background:**

- Maintaining the SVG background's position across different viewport sizes proved to be a hurdle.
- Aligning the background with other elements necessitated a solid understanding of CSS positioning properties.
- Employing `vw` units and defining suitable background image sizes ensured proper scaling for various screen sizes.

### Accessibility Testing

**Screen Reader and Keyboard Accessibility:**

- I'm currently in the process of establishing a workflow for web accessibility testing using screen readers and keyboards.
- Resources like the YouTube video "How to Check Web Accessibility with a Screen Reader and Keyboard" have been instrumental in this process.

### Form Functionality

**Implementation:**

- Initially implemented the form functionality using vanilla JavaScript.
- Subsequently, transitioned the form functionality to NextJS 14 for a more robust framework-based approach.
