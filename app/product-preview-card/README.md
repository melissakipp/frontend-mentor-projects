### What I learned

**Color Naming Conventions**: I learned the importance of using standardized and universal color naming conventions, such as "primary" and "secondary," to ensure clear communication across design and development teams. This practice helps avoid confusion and makes it easier for all team members to understand and apply the color scheme.

**Spacing Consistencies**: I identified the need for consistent spacing values to streamline the design process and make the project more maintainable.

**Responsive Image Handling**: I gained experience in using the srcset and sizes attributes to ensure the correct images are served based on screen width. This involved careful testing and adjustments to address responsive design issues effectively.

**Combining ```<picture>``` and ```<figure>``` Elements**: I understood the distinct roles of the ``` <picture>```  and ``` <figure>```  elements and how they can be combined to enhance semantic HTML and accessibility. Using them together ensures responsive images and provides clear context and descriptions.

**Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: I learned about different types of CDNs and their importance in optimizing image delivery and improving web performance. Using a CDN can reduce latency and ensure faster load times for images and other static assets.

**Proactive Team Collaboration**: Although working solo on the challenge, I adopted a team collaboration mindset by anticipating potential questions and issues. Documenting decisions and maintaining clear coding practices ensured that the project would be easily understandable and integrable into a team workflow.

These insights have not only improved my technical skills but also highlighted the importance of clear communication, consistency, and collaboration in web development projects.
