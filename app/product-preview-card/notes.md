## Improving Design and Development Consistency
### Color Naming Conventions:
- From my experience, keeping naming conventions consistent across design and code is crucial for effective communication between teams. I suggest using universal terms like "primary" and "secondary" for colors. This approach is especially helpful for team members without a design background, making it easier for everyone to adopt these terms.

### Spacing Inconsistencies:
I've observed some inconsistencies in our spacing values.To enhance uniformity, I recommend standardizing these values to a more consistent set like 12px, 14px, 20px, and 28px. This will simplify our design system and ensure easier maintenance and implementation.
